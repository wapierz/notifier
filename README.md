# notifier
Simple post notifier which uses curl library under MIT licence.

# Project description
This project contains header only implementation of HTTP notification client.  It is written in modern c++23  and is based on curl library. 


# Install/run
As was mentioned above it is header only so all you need to do is include notifier.hpp into your project and that's all! However, note that some modern compiler is required (e.g. gcc13) and standard c++23 should be used.
In order to run example from main.cpp just run `./scripts/make_debug.sh && ./scripts/run_debug.sh`.

# Remarks
Any improvements, suggestions or advice are always appreciated :)
